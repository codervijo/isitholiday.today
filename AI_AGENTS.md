# AI Agent Context — isitholiday.today

## What this project is
A programmatic-SEO site that answers one high-frequency query: *"Is today a holiday in [location]?"* — across countries, states, and holiday types (public / bank / school). Static-first, deployed to Cloudflare Pages. Goal: traffic capture via many pSEO pages, not SaaS.

## Stack — locked in
- Vite **^6.3.5** (Cloudflare Pages Wrangler refuses Vite < 6 — non-negotiable)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` ^3.11
- Tailwind 3 + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) + lucide-react
- React Router 6
- TanStack Query 5
- react-helmet-async (head tags)
- pnpm 9 (no npm, no bun — `bun.lock`/`bun.lockb`/`package-lock.json` are gitignored)
- Vitest 3 (pure-function tests, node env)

**Do NOT use:** Astro+MUI (SSR `createTheme` crashes on CJS/ESM interop — abandoned, do not retry); `lovable-tagger` (pins Vite 5); Tailwind 4 (shadcn templates target Tailwind 3).

## Project structure
- `src/main.tsx` — `BrowserRouter` + `QueryClientProvider` + `HelmetProvider`
- `src/App.tsx` — `<Routes>`: `/`, `/holiday-checker`, `/:country`, `/:country/:state`, `*`
- `src/index.css` — Tailwind base/components/utilities + shadcn CSS variables
- `src/components/Calculator.tsx` — single source-of-truth holiday-answer widget (props for prefill)
- `src/components/Layout.tsx`, `Seo.tsx`, `NavLink.tsx`, `InternalLinks.tsx` — shared shells
- `src/components/ui/` — shadcn primitives (`button`, `card`, `input`, `label`, `select`)
- `src/lib/holiday.ts` — pure `getTodayHoliday()` calc; no UI
- `src/lib/holidays.ts` — typed holiday seed data (India + USA)
- `src/lib/data.ts` — `PAGES: SeoPage[]` (slug, title, h1, description, directAnswer, prefill). Add new pSEO pages here — no code changes
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — `cn()` helper
- `src/pages/` — `Index`, `CalculatorPage`, `SeoPageRoute`, `NotFound`
- `src/test/setup.ts` + `src/lib/holiday.test.ts`
- `public/` — robots.txt, favicon.svg
- `genai/` — Lovable reference scaffold; **gitignored**, kept on disk for reference only

## How to build / install / test — docker only
**Do not run `pnpm` (or `npm`/`node`) from the host.** The build environment lives in the parent `sites/` Docker image (`sites1:latest`, built from `../Dockerfile`, Volta-managed Node 18.17.1 + pnpm). The host may have a different Node/pnpm — keep them out of this project.

The parent `sites/` directory mounts at `/usr/src/app` inside the container. The interactive entrypoint is `make buildsh` (from `../`), which runs `dev_container.sh` and drops you into a shell. For agent / scripted use, run one-off commands non-interactively against the same image and mount:

```bash
# from the host, but executing inside the sites1 container:
docker run --rm -v /home/vijo/work/projects/sites:/usr/src/app sites1 \
  bash -c 'cd /usr/src/app/isitholiday.today && pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm test'
```

Inside the container, the parent Makefile targets are also available (they require `IS_DOCKER=yes`, which is true via `/.dockerenv`):
- `make test proj=isitholiday.today` — `pnpm install` → `pnpm build` → `pnpm test`
- `make run proj=isitholiday.today` — `pnpm install` → `pnpm dev` (port 8080)

Project-local scripts (run with `pnpm <script>` inside the container):
- `dev` — vite dev server on :8080
- `build` — `tsc -b && vite build` → `dist/`
- `preview` — serve `dist/` locally
- `test` — `vitest run` (run-once)

If the `sites1` image is missing, build it first with `make buildsh` from `../` (interactive — needs a real terminal) or `docker build -t sites1 ..` from this repo's parent.

## Key conventions
- All holiday math lives in `src/lib/holiday.ts` as a pure function. Calculator.tsx is a thin UI shell — never inline math in components.
- pSEO pages are data-driven via `src/lib/data.ts` + `src/pages/SeoPageRoute.tsx`. To add a page, append an entry — do not create a new route file.
- shadcn-style: `src/components/ui/` uses `class-variance-authority` + `tailwind-merge`. Primitives may use `@radix-ui/*` (Select, Label).
- Path alias `@/` maps to `src/`.
- Each rendered page must include: `<title>`, meta description, canonical, OG tags, H1, direct-answer paragraph, the calculator, and ≥3 internal links to siblings.

## Cloudflare Pages — known traps
1. **Submodule clone failure.** Cloudflare clones with `--recurse-submodules`. If any subdir has its own `.git` and is registered as gitlink (mode 160000) in this repo's index without a matching `.gitmodules`, the clone hard-fails: `"error occurred while updating repository submodules"`. Fix: gitignore the dir AND `git rm --cached <path>`. Verify with `git ls-tree -r HEAD | awk '$2 == "commit"'` (must be empty).
2. **Vite version floor.** Wrangler refuses Vite < 6. Stay on `vite ^6.x`.
3. **Frozen lockfile.** CI runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Whenever `package.json` changes, regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml` locally and commit it in the same change.
4. **Stale src/ from prior scaffolds.** If you swap stacks, fully clean root-owned leftovers (`node_modules`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `.astro`, stray `src/env.d.ts`).

## Prompt history — `docs/Prompts.md`
After a feature ships successfully (commit lands, build green, acceptance criteria met), append the prompt that drove it to `docs/Prompts.md`. Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>` followed by the prompt text and a brief `**Outcome:**` line. Capture only the prompts behind real features, scaffolds, or reusable templates — not every chat, not exploratory questions, not bug-fix back-and-forth. The goal is a durable record of the prompts that produced shipped work.

## Deployment
- **Production domain:** `https://isitholiday.today` (DNS pointed at this Cloudflare Pages project).
- **Host:** Cloudflare Pages, auto-deploying on every push to `main` of `github.com:codervijo/isitholiday.today` (no `wrangler.toml` in repo — CF auto-detects the Vite preset and runs `pnpm install && pnpm build`, publishing `dist/`).
- **Production canonical (hardcoded):** `https://isitholiday.today` in `src/components/Seo.tsx`. If the production domain ever moves, update that constant — every page's `<link rel="canonical">` and `og:url` is derived from it.

### Smoke test after a push
```bash
curl -sIL https://isitholiday.today/ | head -3                          # expect 200 OK
curl -sL  https://isitholiday.today/india/kerala | grep '<h1'           # expect rendered H1, not empty shell
curl -s   https://isitholiday.today/sitemap.xml | grep -c '<loc>'       # expect 11 (or PAGES.length + 2)
curl -sL  https://isitholiday.today/robots.txt | tail -3                # expect Sitemap: line
```

### Known issues / follow-ups
- **Trailing-slash mismatch.** With `ssgOptions.dirStyle: 'nested'`, vite-react-ssg emits `dist/<path>/index.html`. CF Pages serves these at `/<path>/` (trailing slash) and 307-redirects `/<path>` → `/<path>/`. Our `Seo.tsx` canonical and `og:url` use the no-slash form (`https://isitholiday.today/india/kerala`). Result: Google indexes one URL form, the canonical points at the other (which redirects). Not breaking, but unnecessary friction. Fix options when this is worth touching: (a) switch `dirStyle: 'flat'` so files emit at `<path>.html` and the no-slash URL serves directly, or (b) make `Seo.tsx` emit canonical with trailing slash for nested paths.
- **CF Managed Content in robots.txt.** CF prepends an AI-bot block (Amazonbot, ClaudeBot, GPTBot, etc.) above our `public/robots.txt` content. Googlebot is still allowed; our `Sitemap:` line is preserved at the bottom. If the prepend interferes with anything later, it's configurable in the CF Pages dashboard ("AI Audit" / "Block AI Crawlers").

## Out of scope / don't touch
- `genai/` — Lovable reference scaffold, gitignored. Don't modify or delete.
- The parent `sites/` Makefile and `dev_container.sh` — shared across all sibling projects.

## Status
- **Stack settled:** Vite 6 + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind 3 + shadcn/ui + pnpm + `vite-react-ssg`.
- **Live on production:** `https://isitholiday.today` auto-deploys from `main`. 11 static HTML pages indexable, sitemap.xml live.
- **Earlier dead end (do not retry):** Astro + MUI (CJS/ESM interop crash).
- **Next step (per `docs/prd.md` priority queue):** Phase 3-A — extend `SeoPage` schema (`tagline`, `intro`, `howItWorks`, `tips`, `faq`, `lastUpdated`, `keywords`) and backfill all 9 pages. Then Phase 4-C (privacy/terms/about) and the remaining Phase 4-B JSON-LD blocks.

## Goal — guiding principle
This is NOT a product. It's a high-frequency query engine. Success = coverage (many pages) × accuracy (correct daily answer) × speed (fast load). Prefer simplicity over flexibility, speed over completeness, shipping over perfection.

## Versioning

This project follows the two-level versioning convention canonical
to the portfolio (see `sites/portfolio/AI_AGENTS.md` for the full
statement):

- **`vN`** — major capability tier (SemVer-MAJOR semantics).
- **`vN.X`** — phase letter within a tier (A, B, C, …) for
  internal slicing.
- **`vN.X.Y`** — numeric sub-phase for follow-up work that lands
  after `vN.X` shipped.

Track current phase + completed work in `docs/prd.md`.

## Building info

This project's `Makefile` forwards every target to `../Makefile`
(the sites/ workspace) which delegates per-stack work to the central
builder at `~/work/projects/builder/`. Common: `make deps`, `make dev`,
`make build`. Don't duplicate build logic per-site.

## Deployment info

Cloudflare Pages. Push to `main` triggers an auto-build via the
`wrangler.jsonc` config; build output is `dist/`. Custom domain
configured via the CF Pages dashboard.
